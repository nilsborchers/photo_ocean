photo ocean
===========

Loads photos from your flickr stream and displays them in an endless loop best viewed in fullscreen

This whole thing is a result of half a bottle jack daniels, the front trend conference 2014 in warsaw and two awesome dudes who had a great plan.

Check this out if you like and preferrably if you have a couple of nice pictures in your flickr stream that you would like to see on a screen somewhere in your living room.
For me the idea was, that I have my old iMac G3 - which I love - for which I've always wished that it would fulfil a particular use apart from being pretty. So I came up with this funny webapp to give it something to do.

BTW: Ran is the god of the ocean in viking mythology - just in case you're wondering when reading the code :D

Building this thing
-------------------

1. Clone the repo somewhere (caiptn obivouuuusss)
2. Install packages required for building ```bower install && npm install```
3. Once all that stuff is installed you can run grunt in dev mode, if you wanna hack around this thing ```grunt serve``` or to create a static blob to uplaod somewhere running ```grunt build```.

Actually there's not a lot going on outside the main.js but you get all of this npm, bower and grunt awesomeness with courtesy of yeoman :)
